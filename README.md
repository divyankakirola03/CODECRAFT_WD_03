Task 3: Basic Login System

Description
A basic Python login system that allows users to input a username and password, and verifies the credentials against a predefined dictionary.

How to Use
1. Run the `login_system.py` file in any Python environment (like Pyroid).
2. Input the username and password when prompted.
3. If the credentials are correct, a success message is displayed. Otherwise, access is denied.

Example
```
=== LOGIN SYSTEM ===
Enter username: user1
Enter password: password1
Login successful!
```
